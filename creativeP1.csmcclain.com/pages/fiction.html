            Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so 
            frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, 
            and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. <br><br>

            It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their 
            Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into 
            near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<br><br>
            
            One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical 
            apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no 
            sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the 
            leaders who consider them expendable.<br><br>
            
            Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated 
            by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights 
            Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<br><br>
            
            Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious 
            heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. 
            As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause 
            of the war.
