          <h2>A breif history of cats.</h2>
          <p>Cats began their unique relationship with humans 10,000 to 12,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent,
        the geographic region where some of the earliest developments in human civilization occurred (encompassing
        modern day parts of West Asia). One such development was agriculture. As people abandoned their nomadic lifestyle
        and settled permanently to farm the land, stored grain attracted rodents. Taking advantage of this new, abundant
        food source, Middle Eastern wildcats, or felix silvestris lybica, preyed on the rodents and decided to stick around these
        early towns, scavenging the garbage that all human societies inevitably produce just as feral cats do today.
          </p>
          <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
          <p>Thought to have descended from the African wildcat and used to catch vermin, 
              the domestic cat can be traced all the way back to ancient Egypt 4,000 years ago (and 
              perhaps beyond). By helping to reduce disease and protect crops, cats were quickly regarded 
              as sacred creatures by the Egyptians.
            </p>

           <h3>The wandering cat</h3>
           <p>
            After the Egyptian dynasty collapsed, cats became popular elsewhere. In the Far East, cats were 
            originally owned by the rich. As their popularity grew, the domesticated cat made its way to surrounding 
            countries like India and Japan. 
            This is when breeding also began, with breeds such as the Siamese and Burmese first emerging.
           </p>

           <h3>Cats today</h3>
           <p>
            Nowadays, cats are a key part of modern society its estimated there are close to half a billion 
            around the world. They continue to be an important and special part of our lives. Were always looking 
            for new ways to show them how much we care. 
            So, actually, when you consider how revered cats were by the Egyptians not much has actually changed.
